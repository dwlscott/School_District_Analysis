# School_District_Analysis

## Background:

- Here we were asked by the school district to compile a set of data for fifteen schools. To determine which of those schools were performing at expectations or below them. But due to a possible academic dishonesty issue. We were then re-assigned to remove the freshmen results of Thomas Hight School. Re- evaluate the data, and describe how these results have altered the school district analysis results. 

## Analysis/Results:

- The school district summary was only slightly effected. As the original data showed the math passing percent of 74.98%, the reading passing precent as 85.85%, and an overall passing percent of 65.17%. When the data was refactored to excluded freshman at THS, the passing math ended up being 74.8%, While reading was 85.7%, and the overall passing was 64.9%. Which equates to a change of 0.18% change for math percentage. A  0.15% change for reading percentage. And a 0.27% for the overall passing percentage.

- The school summary was not exactly effected. All the data except one came back exactly the same. That exception was Bailey High school. Which individually both results were the same. $628 dollars per student, for both the original data, and the altered data. The range of the original one matches. However, the altered one does not. This is most likely due to the budget bins created being slightly different. However, all the data is the same...

- Replacing the ninth graders math, and reading score doesn’t technically affect Thomas High School performance. The reason why is the data was just replaced with NaN, we did not change the total students being accounted for.  But because we're dealing with math, and generalized sig figs… Yes, the data itself changed. But their placement as a top performing school did not. That being said, the only thing that did change was the overall passing percentage by a negligible 0.31768%.

- As stated above, replacing the 9th grade scores does not effect the data set too much. Because the data was just replace by another variable, NaN. So while it still has an effect, its a small one. Since the rest of the data is the same. See images below.

- As indicated by the results posted below (left being original data, and the right being altered data). They both clearly show that refracting that freshmen data of THS did not change anything.

- As for the school size and their budgets. They were the same. The only difference was the percentages were off. But the averages, and overall, were exactly the same. As show by the images below, (left being the original, right being the altered).

 - Both of the data sets, show that nothing was altered or changed. By refactoring the freshmen of THS. This is further proved by the data sets, that both charter and district categorized school did not change.

## Summary:

- Rapping up the assignment, we can conclude that refactoring the freshman reading, and math scores did change a few things to the analysis. It however, did not change a lot. See,  the school district summary was only slightly changed. Meaning that there was a change between the two data sets to be off by 0.18% for math percentages, 0.15% for reading percentages, and the overall percentage had change of 0.27%. Continuing on, the other data set that was altered, when dropping THS freshmen was interesting. The thing is, their performance as top school did not change, as they were still out of five, second. What did change, was their overall passing percentages dropped by 0.31768%. Next thing that was altered was the school size and budget. Everything technically was the same but the percentages were off. But the averages for both math and reading were the same. Last thing that was altered, was intresting, and it delt with a different school. More specifically the spending ranges happened to be different. But for another school. While the data was exactly the same. The spending range was different, and didn’t even fall between the range that was spent on each student. Meaning, $628 is spend on Bailey high school students. But the range is $630-644…two dollars off to be exact. In addition, while not exactly related…It’s interesting to think about, how schools with less funding, and around the same number of students. Out performed schools with more funding.  But overall dropping the data of the freshmen of Thomas High did alter the analysis. But not too much.
